#My NVIM Config

I used astrovim template to get started and built upon it. 

I'm a webdev so you'll find added plugins such as `ts`, `js`, `html-css`, `tailwind` & `docker`. 

I have also added the java pack from astro community.

I have added other helper packs such `mini-animate`, `rainbow-delimiters`, `hover-nvim`, `trouble-nvim`.

Apart from this there's come visual customization such as the `catpuccin` theme in `frappe` flavour. `nvim-web-devicons`. 

The startup header text says "Vs Code", you can change it to whatever but I found it funny so, yeah. 

If you decide to use this, go wild with it! Good luck on your nvim journey. Peace.
