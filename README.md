This is my config of nvim.

I am new to vim, so to start with I've followed a tutorial from NeuralNine on Youtube. You can find his config on his github. My config, even though it has the same plugins as his for now, is not exactly the same. I wish to improve upon this config overtime as I continue learn about git. 

You can use this config as a starting point as well.
