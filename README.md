# My NVIM Config

I used astrovim template to get started and built upon it. 

I'm a webdev so you'll find added plugins such as `ts`, `js`, `html-css`, `tailwind` & `docker`. 

I have also added the java pack from astro community.

I have added other helper packs such `mini-animate`, `rainbow-delimiters`, `hover-nvim`, `trouble-nvim`.

Apart from this there's come visual customization such as the `catpuccin` theme in `frappe` flavor. `nvim-web-devicons`. 

The startup header text says "Vs Code", you can change it to whatever but I found it funny so, yeah. 

### Usage Instructions 

Prerequisites:
	`nvim` - latest version.

Note: I recommend creating a backup of your existing `nvim` config 

Go to your `nvim` directory which should be at the following path:

```bash
cd ~/.config/nvim
```

Here you'll find the existing config, get rid of it. Paste my config files into that folder, save.

```bash
nvim
```

Run `nvim` and it should automatically perform all necessary installations at startup.  

If you decide to use this, go wild with it! Good luck on your `nvim` journey. Peace.
